**Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.** Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Welcome here!

I'm more than happy to announce that the **OCEAN GAMING** is now live! It is still in beta, but feel free to join the community and play on the servers.
Check out the servers tab and get instant access to the game servers, or just copy the addresses from below.

## Who is OCEAN GAMING?

**OCEAN GAMING** exists to help people to get better in the game with deathmach mode, but also to relive the popular mods with the simplicity of the past.
On demand more and more servers can be added later.
Note: **OCEAN GAMING** is built and maintained by a single person as a hobby, as a passion, so please keep in mind that changes could take some time. Also the rig under the servers is financed alone.

## The servers

While configuring the servers the main goal was to keep it as simple as possible, not to overload the players with mods and downloadable content that doesn't even add to to experience. Also
it is very important to me to be able to play some old, classic maps together, soon the playable maps will be listed on the blog. The list is going to be updated continuously with new maps.
